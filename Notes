-ok, now we need to add this database workout log project that has a front end and backend
-let's first copy the code over from our assignment, then separate the front end and back end parts; we should probably delete our proxy
server app and world's tallest mountains backend that we initially used app from Heroku first, so that we can add these frontend and 
backend apps
-alright, so we need to delete the proxy and the app that is run on the public html site, but what are their names? ok, so here's the 
code from public html 'proxy = "https://warm-taiga-26874.herokuapp.com/"', so that looks to be the proxy. Actually, on our app dashboard
wouldn't these just be the first 2 apps we have? Yeah, so it looks like warmtaiga and saltyplains are the two that we have from a while
ago, so we should delete those. So, let's delete them, and make sure all our apps work?
-ugh, there's no way to add notes it seems, we can rename an app, but then we might need to redeploy it or whatever, so I guess we can
just keep the reference to what each app does in our vs code files
-alright, so we configured all the files and tried the local web and the page comes up, but obv it doesn't work bc we don't have the
server set up yet, so let's go ahead and set that up, then we can fully test this to see if it works.
- ok, so we created the backend and uploaded the app to the cloud, now, let's update our serverURL to the backend URL and test it in
heroku local before creating the frontend app
- lol, so we try to submit something, and it doesn't work, which is obviously really bad. we look over our code, presumable bc it's bad
and don't see anything, so we go to the browser console, and it looks like... a freaking CORS error, we can't access our backend from
local host, and we are out of apps, so I guess we need to deploy this app as well and hope things go well, bc we can't really test it
it seems
