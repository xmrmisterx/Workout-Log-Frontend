-ok, now we need to add this database workout log project that has a front end and backend
-let's first copy the code over from our assignment, then separate the front end and back end parts; we should probably delete our proxy
server app and world's tallest mountains backend that we initially used app from Heroku first, so that we can add these frontend and 
backend apps
-alright, so we need to delete the proxy and the app that is run on the public html site, but what are their names? ok, so here's the 
code from public html 'proxy = "https://warm-taiga-26874.herokuapp.com/"', so that looks to be the proxy. Actually, on our app dashboard
wouldn't these just be the first 2 apps we have? Yeah, so it looks like warmtaiga and saltyplains are the two that we have from a while
ago, so we should delete those. So, let's delete them, and make sure all our apps work?
-ugh, there's no way to add notes it seems, we can rename an app, but then we might need to redeploy it or whatever, so I guess we can
just keep the reference to what each app does in our vs code files
-alright, so we configured all the files and tried the local web and the page comes up, but obv it doesn't work bc we don't have the
server set up yet, so let's go ahead and set that up, then we can fully test this to see if it works.
- ok, so we created the backend and uploaded the app to the cloud, now, let's update our serverURL to the backend URL and test it in
heroku local before creating the frontend app
- lol, so we try to submit something, and it doesn't work, which is obviously really bad. we look over our code, presumable bc it's bad
and don't see anything, so we go to the browser console, and it looks like... a freaking CORS error, we can't access our backend from
local host, and we are out of apps, so I guess we need to deploy this app as well and hope things go well, bc we can't really test it
it seems
- our APP ADDRESS: https://arcane-wildwood-69561.herokuapp.com/ and APP GIT ADDRESS: https://git.heroku.com/arcane-wildwood-69561.git
- wow, WTF, we are still getting cors errors from one heroku app to another, very awkward, so how do we get around this?
- interesting, so we noticed that we didn't set up the server for heroku deployment, so we did, and now we are getting a JSON parsing
error, do we have all the files we need, the body parser and all that? godamit, I thought we tested the backend already, so annoying.
-damit, is the server acting up? let's test the server again, bc it doesn't seem to be working... how do we even test the server? we can
use that Google API requests to make sure it's working I guess?
-hmmm actually just going to our current backend server "https://cryptic-dusk-31004.herokuapp.com/" does give us an internal server error, I guess we tested this as a local host file, but did we test it as a non local host file, bc we should be getting that object 
back, so let's try to test the backend and get the get request to return normally, and also maybe the reset table get request
-ok, so we finally get the backend to work, our issue was a lot bigger than just some error, we needed the "clearDB" addon in order to
use mySQL with heroku, now, this frontend needs some work
-create a description for what the page does, then change the text of the edit button to "save" bc that's what it does, it doesn't edit,
it saves the info
-ugh, so our local host wasn't running when we "heroku run node server.js" so we think it's just not working, but uploading the app doesn't work either. we look over our code and notice the port is still local, so we change it to heroku port and upload again
